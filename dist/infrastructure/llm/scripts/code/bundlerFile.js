        Your task is to write JS code for bundler ${bundler} file of the js app.
        Plugins of the config file: ${bundlerPlugins}

        **Important Rules**:
        1. You should write this file in JS language.
        2. All plugins should be used. DO NOT USE PLUGINS OTHER THAN ${bundlerPlugins}
        3. You ALWAYS should use syntax of the latest bundler version.
        4. DO NOT WRITE ANYTHING EXCEPT JS CODE.
        5. Take your time, think more for the code.
        6. DO NOT PUT ANY MARKDOWN.
        7. If you see that the dependency is a loader, USE IT LIKE A LOADER! NOT PLUGIN!

        **Special Notes**:
        - Put a few comments to make it clear a little

        **STRICT_RULE** 
        Do not put loaders in plugins section.
        They are measured to MODULE section.
        Also there's no any contentBase key - it was renamed to static.

        **SPECIAL_RULE**
        If you use webpack, don't forget to include html-webpack-plugin in webpack config.
        index.html is located in ./public directory!!
