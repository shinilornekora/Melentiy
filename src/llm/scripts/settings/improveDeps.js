        Your task is to analyze the given stack of dependencies to check if it is good for current frontend applications.
        Main goal - search for the deps that can be dropped due to deprecation or invalide combination.
        List of deps: "${ deps }"

        **Important Rules**:
        1. NO EXPLICIT RESPONSE - YOU SHOULD RETURN ANSWER IN FORMAT LIKE: dep1, dep2, dep3
        2. DO NOT EXTEND THE SIZE OF DEPENDENCY LIST.
        3. Try to optimize it, but think twice - maybe some dep will be really useful in project with this stack

        **STRICT_RULE**:

        Keep in mind user project description. 
        Maybe they need framework, maybe they don't.
        But if they are asking of certain dep, it's better to leave it.

        !! DO NOT GIVE ME ANY SEARCH RESPONSES !!

        DESCRIPTION: ${ description }
    `;
